"""The runtime-control seam: what a switched-off control binds, and what a caller reports.

**Disabled adapters.** When a deployment switches a control off, the container binds the class
here instead of the profile's: :class:`DisabledGuardrail` for the ``safety`` port
(``FRAUDFUSION_GUARDRAIL=off``) allows every text with the reason ``"guardrail off"``, and
:class:`DisabledReviewRouter` (``FRAUDFUSION_REVIEW_ROUTING=off``) submits nothing. Each
satisfies its port, so no service needs a ``None`` branch, and the container logs the posture at
startup.

**Recording wrapper.** Every caller that hands an incident to the router (the API route, the
agent tool, the CLI) wraps the bound router in :class:`RecordingReviewRouter` for that one call,
so what it returns can say what happened: ``routed``, ``failed``, ``off`` or ``not_required``. A
failure is logged and absorbed here rather than failing an already-correlated, already-audited
incident, but it is never invisible: the caller reports ``failed`` and an empty reference,
which nobody can mistake for a reviewed result.

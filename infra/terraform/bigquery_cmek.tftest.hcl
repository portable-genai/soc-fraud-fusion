# bigquery_cmek.tftest.hcl: the key the dataset stamps onto its tables, asserted at PLAN time.
#
# `mock_provider` only, so this runs with NO credentials, NO project and NO network beyond the
# provider download, the same way the rest of this directory's tests do:
#
#   terraform init -backend=false && terraform test
#
# What it defends. The dataset declares a `default_encryption_configuration`, so BigQuery stamps
# that key onto every table it creates in the dataset. A `google_bigquery_table` resource that
# declares no `encryption_configuration` therefore describes a table the server has already keyed,
# and the next plan reads the absent block as a REMOVAL. Removing an encryption configuration
# FORCES REPLACEMENT: the table is destroyed and recreated, and a recreated table holds no rows.
# Proved by execution against a sibling deployment on 2026-09-12, where every loaded table planned
# as `must be replaced` with `encryption_configuration { # forces replacement }` as the cause.
# CMEK cascades in BigQuery's model and not in Terraform's, which is why the key is named twice.
#
# PRESENCE, not the key id: under `mock_provider` the crypto key's id is unknown at plan time, so
# comparing against it is an unresolvable condition rather than a check. The identity of the key is
# asserted textually instead, by `tests/contract/test_demo_book.py`, which also fails when a table
# is added later with no block at all. This file is the plan-level half: it proves the declaration
# survives into a plan rather than merely appearing in the source.

# model_armor.tf: the Model Armor guardrail template the `gcp` guardrail adapter screens
# through (rule R1).
#
# Principle map (COMPLIANCE.md):
#   P-04 / R1 (guardrail screening): src/soc_fraud_fusion/adapters/gcp/safety.py screens through this template for prompt
#         injection, jailbreak, sensitive-data leakage and malicious URLs.
#   P-05 (residency): the template is created in the region this stack runs in (local.region)
#         and called on that region's Model Armor host, never the global endpoint.
#
# The serving edge (production_edge.tf) hands the service this resource's template_id whenever
# the guardrail is on, so the service can only ever name a template this file creates. Before
# this file the id was a free-text input that defaulted to empty and nothing created.
#
# The malicious-URI filter and multi-language detection are NOT served in every region: a region
# that refuses them fails the whole template with CAPABILITY_NOT_SUPPORTED rather than degrading,
# so both are gated on var.model_armor_full_capabilities, which defaults to false (slice 7 of the
# posture rule: a control that is not irreversible defaults off in code). A deployment in a region
# that serves both states true; terraform.tfvars.example states false for asia-southeast1.
#

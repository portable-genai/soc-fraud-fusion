"""Rebrand this base repo for your institution or vertical in one pass.

Rewrites the python package name (which is also this repo's console-script name), the
``FRAUDFUSION`` environment prefix behind every ``FRAUDFUSION_PROFILE``-style variable, the
distribution and resource id ``soc-fraud-fusion`` and the Terraform
``name_prefix`` default, so a fork does not have to hunt them down by hand. It is a mechanical
text and directory rename, deliberately conservative: it prints a plan, writes nothing unless
you pass ``--yes``, and by default leaves Markdown prose alone (pass ``--include-docs`` to
sweep that too).

    # See what would change (writes nothing):
    python scripts/rename_fork.py --package acme_fraud_fusion \
        --env-prefix ACMEFUSION --resource acme-fraud-fusion \
        --name-prefix acme-fusion --dry-run

    # Apply it:
    python scripts/rename_fork.py --package acme_fraud_fusion \
        --env-prefix ACMEFUSION --resource acme-fraud-fusion \
        --name-prefix acme-fusion --yes

There is deliberately no ``--cli`` flag. This repo's console script is named after the PACKAGE:
the ``[project.scripts]`` entry point in ``pyproject.toml`` is
``soc_fraud_fusion``, so ``--package`` renames the CLI as well and a
second flag could only drift out of step with it.

``--resource`` is one literal doing four jobs: the distribution name in ``pyproject.toml``, the
GitHub id in ``[project.urls]``, the A2A agent-card name and the Hrz4 eval bundle id. They are
the same string on purpose, so a fork's promotion record and its discovery card cannot disagree
about which system they describe.

``--name-prefix`` is the Terraform ``name_prefix`` default that every deployed resource name is
derived from. It is rewritten ONLY inside its own variable block in
``infra/terraform/variables.tf``, and its current value is READ from there rather than
hardcoded here. Both halves matter: it is a short word, and a whole-tree replacement of a short
word is how a rename script corrupts prose it was never asked to touch, while a hardcoded old
value would stop matching the moment somebody renames this repo a second time.

After running: recreate the venv and ``pip install -e ".[dev]"`` (the distribution name
changed), then prove it is green with ``make gate``. See ``docs/ADOPTING.md`` for the human
decisions (region, IdP, policy numbers, fixtures, eval golden set) this script does NOT make
for you.

"""ONE canonical request per port, shared by the structural and behavioural contract suites.

Parity means the same request through every implementation, so the request needs a single home.
Retyping it per suite is how two "parity" tests end up asserting different things.

Each :class:`PortCase` answers three questions about one port:

* ``invoke``   : what a single canonical call to this port looks like;
* ``answered`` : what it means for the OFFLINE family to have actually answered (a port that
  returns ``None`` and records nothing has not answered, it has merely not raised);
* ``managed_refusal`` : what the MANAGED family must do when called with no cloud reachable.
  Never a silent success: either it refuses because it is unconfigured, or its lazy SDK import
  fails. Both are honest; returning as if the work happened is not.

Adding a port means adding a case here. ``test_port_parity.py`` fails the build if this table
and the port map ever disagree, so the touch list in ``CONTRIBUTING.md`` is enforced rather than
merely written down.

"""Prove the SHIPPED pii_safety metric is not structurally falsely green (the C4 lesson).

The proof drives ``eval/run_eval.py``'s own scorer, not a lookalike written for the test. A
falsification proof scored against a local helper proves the helper works and says nothing about
the metric the gate runs, which is exactly how a metric that reads one field of a multi-field
record stayed green while the identifier sat in the record beside it.

The green and red inputs are REAL persisted audit rows from the real pipeline: the same fusion,
once with the redaction boundary in place and once with the raw identifier put back into the row
the way an unmasked citation puts it there.
